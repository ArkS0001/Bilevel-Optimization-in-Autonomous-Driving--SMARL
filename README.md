Ensuring safety in MARL, particularly when deploying it in real-world ap- plications such as autonomous driving, emerges as a critical challenge. To address this challenge, traditional safe MARL methods extend MARL ap- proaches to incorporate safety considerations, aiming to minimize safety risk values.
